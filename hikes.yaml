    Lots of views along the way, you can stop at Cod Rock if you want to give up
    early. There's a small rocky beach (Maple Beach) near Admiralty Point which
    is great for throwing rocks into the water.

    Wide, slow switchbacks up the ridge

    Lots of moss of course.

    At some times of the year there are lots of little springs crossing the trail (under little bridges).

    Very fun even if you only go a little ways up.
