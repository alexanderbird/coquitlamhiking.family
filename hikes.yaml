    Lots of views along the way, you can stop at Cod Rock if you want to give up
    early. There's a small rocky beach (Maple Beach) near Admiralty Point which
    is great for throwing rocks into the water.

    lots of little springs crossing the trail (under little bridges). Very fun
    even if you only go a little ways up
