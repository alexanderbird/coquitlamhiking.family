    Lots of views along the way, you can stop at Cod Rock if you want to give up
    early. There's a small rocky beach (Maple Beach) near Admiralty Point which
    is great for throwing rocks into the water.

    Wide, slow switchbacks up the ridge

    Lots of moss of course.

    At some times of the year there are lots of little springs crossing the trail (under little bridges).

    Very fun even if you only go a little ways up.

    This is a popular trail, probably because you get stunning views as soon as
    you start the walk. The path is a wide, flat, gravel path.

    The path meets with the path that goes along the south side of the Deboville
    Slough, so if you want a really really long walk you could start here, walk
    to the start of the Deboville Slough north trail, and then walk along there.

    Nicer views than the path along the Pitt River, but you have to walk further
    before you get to them. Nice wide, flat, gravel paths. Beautiful. 

    At the end of the trail (after it turns towards Minnekhada park), there is a
    fork to the right that leads to a birding observation deck.

    Smooth, wide, winding paths through a beautiful forest. There are several
    bridges across creeks. If you start at the stairs on the Northeast side you
    can do a loop&colon; down either of the paths, across the lower bridge, up
    to Harper road, and then a short walk on the sidewalk back to the stairs
    where you started. If you want a longer walk, instead of taking the right
    fork on the upward part of the loop, take the left fork which is a
    there-and-back path across another bridge leading to a view.

    A beautiful winding forest loop with boardwalks. It's almost stroller

    are several rooty and rocky sections that you'll have to carry even the most
    offroad-ready stroller over.

    Follow the Munro Lake Trail until you get to the Dennet Lake Bluffs rock
    climbing area. Backtrack a few minutes to just below the large rock and head
    off the trail towards the creek. There are a few routes down, but you may
    have to look around a bit to find the way.
