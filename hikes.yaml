    Lots of views along the way, you can stop at Cod Rock if you want to give up
    early. There's a small rocky beach (Maple Beach) near Admiralty Point which
    is great for throwing rocks into the water.

    Wide, slow switchbacks up the ridge

    Lots of moss of course.

    At some times of the year there are lots of little springs crossing the trail (under little bridges).

    Very fun even if you only go a little ways up.

    This is a popular trail, probably because you get stunning views as soon as
    you start the walk. The path is a wide, flat, gravel path.

    The path meets with the path that goes along the south side of the Deboville
    Slough, so if you want a really really long walk you could start here, walk
    to the start of the Deboville Slough north trail, and then walk along there.

    Nicer views than the path along the Pitt River, but you have to walk further
    before you get to them. Nice wide, flat, gravel paths. Beautiful. 

    At the end of the trail (after it turns towards Minnekhada park), there is a
    fork to the right that leads to a birding observation deck.
